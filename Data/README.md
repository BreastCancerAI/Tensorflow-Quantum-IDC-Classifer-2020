# Breast Histopathology Images
The dataset used in this project is an open dataset: [Breast Histopathology Images](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images "Breast Histopathology Images") by [Paul Mooney](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney "Paul Mooney") on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com "Kaggle").

"The original dataset consisted of 162 whole mount slide images of Breast Cancer (BCa) specimens scanned at 40x. From that, 277,524 patches of size 50 x 50 were extracted (198,738 IDC negative and 78,786 IDC positive). Each patch’s file name is of the format: uxXyYclassC.png — > example 10253idx5x1351y1101class0.png . Where u is the patient ID (10253idx5), X is the x-coordinate of where this patch was cropped from, Y is the y-coordinate of where this patch was cropped from, and C indicates the class where 0 is non-IDC and 1 is IDC."

In our project we will use a dataset made up from the Breast Histopathology Images.
